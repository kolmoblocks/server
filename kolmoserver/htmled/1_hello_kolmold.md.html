<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>KolmoLD is a network protocol that rethinks the tech stack behind the modern internet.</p>
<p>The tech stack that powers the internet (IP, TCP, BGP) relies on the model where a internet resource runs on its own machine:</p>
<pre><code>
</code></pre>
<p>Within that model, the internet resource and the network identity of the computer it runs on is interchangable. </p>
<p>As the internet evolved, limitations of that approach became apparent. The industry moved towards distributed systems, where ainternetb resource is run on multiple machines.</p>
<p>Such an approach is dictated by the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scalability: a internet resource's workload does not fit in a single computer [1]  </li>
<li>Edge hosting: performance engineering requires hostinginternetb resources as geographically close to the consumer as possible [2]</li>
</ol>
<p>The art of distributed web system is building a distributed system that behave as if it was fitting the single computer - singleinternetb resource pattern [1]. Multiple challenges and limitations in the domain stem from this limitation.</p>
<p>At the core of KolmoLD is the concept of separation of concerns: separating the logic of internet resource and the network computers that execute it.</p>
