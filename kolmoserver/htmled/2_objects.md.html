<p>Computation can viewed as data objects being transfomed into other data objects. Here by a data object, we refer to arbitrary chunk of data. </p>
<p>Data objects may contain data structures, assets.</p>
<p>KolmoLD specifies a special kind of data objects that can contain arbitrary algorithms: kolmoblocks. The alogirthms are encoded in a  Webassembly-based bytecode format.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Hello" - </li>
